  <h2>"So, who is this Parkerrr guy?", you may be asking. I'm a marketer, a designer, and a developer. I'm interested in products, and how people interact with them.</h2>
    <p>A question that always enters my head when I look at a new product is, "Why would someone use this?".  The answer is almost always related to the fact that it makes that person's life easier. What I like about marketing is the psychology around deciding to use a product. Design goes hand in hand with marketing, building visual cues, and defining the personality of a product, and development is the truly fun part to me. Building a product with the features customers need and want, and deciding which ones to start with. It's such a fun process to launch a product, and I  truly enjoy every part of the process.
</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I used to draw these super heroes with utility belts. Remember those Batman action figures that had specific kits? Like a Batman with an ice cannon. He had blue armor. It was a a unique approach to reimagining the default Batman style. It wasn't that the regular batman couldn't handle an ice cannon, it's just that a Batman designed specifically for it was so much cooler. My super hero designs were focused around really niche scenarios, like jungle warfare, or aerial recon. Each of them had specific tools and characteristics to get their job done. 
</p>

<p>The point is that some of the best products focus on solving a specific problem. They don't try to solve every single problem. The focus on the pain points of a niche, and build their products to ease those pain points. Take Github for example. Software development is a hell of a drug. When you're on a team, working on the same code, you want to make sure each developer is working with the most up-to-date code, and they have all the dependencies needed. Hosting your project on Github (and using revision control in general) relieves the pain point of developers sharing their code. Of course, Github is more than just a place to host code. They now handle Gantt charts, Photoshop file previews, documentation/wikis, and more. 
</p>

<p>
My practice in marketing is backed by data. So Much Data. It's not just demographics anymore. It's about starting a conversation with your customers and following through on their response. Social Media certainly makes it easy to interact with current and potential customers, but that's just one touch point. My current focus is in email-based marketing. Communicating through email is still in it's prime. Yes, there's products like Slack that do a good job of limiting your interaction with your inbox, but much like your physical mailbox, you tend to check in more often than not. It's still a hub for communications for many people. Especially those who aren't big nerds. 
</p>

<h2>I'm always interested in learning new techniques, in marketing, design, and development. I have so many ideas that while on paper, they're useless. So this site is all about me putting my ideas into action. I hope you enjoy!</h2>
