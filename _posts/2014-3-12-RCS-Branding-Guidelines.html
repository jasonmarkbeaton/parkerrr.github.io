<h2>Creating a Brand is Hard Work. Just a few short months ago, I launched a re-branding for RCS.</h2> <p><em>It was only 1 month prior to that launch</em> that I approached the CEO about where their brand stood in the eyes of our customers. We needed to refresh our customers on where we stood in our market, and what we are capable of. <b>That's where branding really comes in</b></p>

<h2>Let me start by introducing you to our new brand</h2>

<h2>Saying it Without Words</h2>

<p>Many great designers are able to communicate their message using only visual representation - *no actual words*. It's an incredibly versitile skill in today's world where images are used more to recapture the readers attention. My goal was to tell our customers just enough, while keeping our logo as simple and iconic as possible.</p>

<h2>I'll rewind a bit to show you what I was working with</h2>

<p>This logo was created for us a little over 5 years ago</p>

<p>So where to start? I decided to pick our colour palette first. Our original logo was in 2 colors, green and blue. In color theory, we're talking the color of money and trust. **Definitely want to keep those two colors, not only for those factors but also to stay familiar to our existing customer base**. I chose one primary color, a sort of light blue, and white for a clean and "transparent" aspect. I would end up using a green color for accent when developing our marketing materials.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to make the RCS logo more iconic, and more recognizeable. So I went back to basics.</p>

<p>Basic shapes are by nature the most recognizeable. I'm talking squares, circles, triangles. Like those blocks you played with as a kid, trying to fit them in the proper bucket. A square was the best fit for us. A strong foundational shape, with slightly rounded edges. It was a bit plain looking, so after some experimenting, I added a subtle gradient from left to right.</p> 

<p>Here's a bit more detail on the logo:</p>

<p>Close-up, you can see some of the more subtle effects. At smaller resolutions, the details are lost, but it keeps the same clean aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Refreshing our Web Presence</h2>

<p>My favorite thing about branding projects is seeing how all the pieces come together, *the website especially*. Our old site followed an overused layout, with little, to no uniqueness in it. **Full Disclosure** *I put that site together a little over 2 years ago.* In an effort to reclaim my Development creds, I went all out on the new website. Built on Wordpress, I implemented new features on the backend to track how our visitors were using it including:</p> 

<ul><li><em>Google Analytics</em> For tracking conversion points</li>
<li><em>Inspectlet</em> Awesome service that shows you exactly how your visitors are using your site.</li>
<li><em>King Sumo Headlines</em> A fantastic plugin that allows you to track which headline for your posts convert more visitors.</li>
<li><em>Cloudflare CDN</em> Cloudflare provides great uptime, and response for serving your content efficiently.</li> 
<li><em>Disqus</em> We wanted a way to provide a better commenting service. Disqus was the answer.</li>
<li><em>Google Authorship</em> If you want to add an extra bump in your search engine results on Google, this is the quickest, and easiest way.</li>
<li><em>Bit.ly</em> I created a custom Bit.ly shortURL generator with a unique domain name for tracking our links/pages and how they perform in our email newsletters.</li>
<li><em>Schema Markup</em> For events, and future items we'll be selling on our website.</li>

<p>Here's a view of the current website</p>

<img src="/images/rcs-website.jpg" alt="New RCS Website"><p>Following suit with our branding guidelines, this site is clean, yet colorful; informative, but casual. You can visit it at www.retailcontrolsystems.com</p>

<p>The final version was the result of many iterations, which our management team helped with, and tested with our customers. With **Inspectly** I was able to confirm interactions were working correctly, and as we iterate on the current site, I can continue my A/B testing to see which pages are succeeding in their goal.</p>
